```Cron is a format used on crontab, a program that allows you
To execute commands on a schedule

In the case of this bot, it is used to set the "reset schedule"

The way --cronset must be formatted is like this:
--cronset `* * * * *`
The * represents "every number" or "every time"
but you can also use specific numbers
acording with card below

*    *    *    *    *
┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬
│    │    │    │    │
│    │    │    │    └ Day of week (0 - 7) (0 or 7 is Sun)
│    │    │    └───── Month (1 - 12)
│    │    └────────── Day of month (1 - 31)
│    └─────────────── Hour (0 - 23)
└──────────────────── Minute (0 - 59)

For example doing "--cronset `0 7 * * 5`"
will execute the reset schedule every  friday at 7 AM UTC
why we use UTC? because that is what the server uses

There are other commands that can be used to customize the 
schedule even further but to learn more about that and
to use a template for your cron tabs go to:

For a more simple command to set the schedule use **--timer HOUR**
