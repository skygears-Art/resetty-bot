```cron is a format use on crontab a program that allow you
to execute comands on a diferent time

in the case of this bot is use to set the "reset schedule"

the way cronset must be use is by doing this
--cron `* * * * *`
those can represent all the numbers that can be use there
you can also specified specific numbers acording with the
chart bellow

*    *    *    *    *
┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬
│    │    │    │    │
│    │    │    │    └ day of week (0 - 7) (0 or 7 is Sun)
│    │    │    └───── month (1 - 12)
│    │    └────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│    └─────────────── hour (0 - 23)
└──────────────────── minute (0 - 59)

for example doing "--cronset `0 7 * * 5`"
will execute the reset schedule every  friday at 3 AM
or 7 AM UTC, why we use UTC? because the server this bot
is hosted uses that time

there is other comand that can be use to custimize the 
schedule even further but to learn more about then and
use a template for your cron taks go to
https://crontab.guru/ for more info help```

if this comand is too complex just use **--timer** for ease of use
