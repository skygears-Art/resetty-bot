```cron is a format use on crontab a program that allow you
to execute comands on a schelude

in the case of this bot is use to set the "reset schedule"

the way --cronset must be format is like this
--cronset `* * * * *`
the * represent "every number" or "every time"
but you can also specific number see chart below
to know what you can use whenre

*    *    *    *    *
┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬
│    │    │    │    │
│    │    │    │    └ day of week (0 - 7) (0 or 7 is Sun)
│    │    │    └───── month (1 - 12)
│    │    └────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│    └─────────────── hour (0 - 23)
└──────────────────── minute (0 - 59)

for example doing "--cronset `0 7 * * 5`"
will execute the reset schedule every  friday at 3 AM
or 7 AM UTC, why we use UTC? because the server this bot
is hosted uses that time

there is other comand that can be use to custimize the 
schedule even further but to learn more about then and
use a template for your cron taks go to
https://crontab.guru/ for more info help```

for a more simple command to set the schedule use **--timer HOUR**
